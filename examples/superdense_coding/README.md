# Superdense Coding

Superdense coding is a quantum communication protocol that allows the transmission of two classical bits of information using only one qubit`[1]`. It takes advantage of quantum entanglement and the ability to manipulate qubits in superposition. Charles H. Bennett and Stephen Wiesner proposed this technique in 1970(though it was not published until 1992`[2]`) and it was experimentally realised in 1996 by Klaus Mattle, Harald Weinfurter, Paul G. Kwiat, and Anton Zeilinger utilising entangled photon pairs.
