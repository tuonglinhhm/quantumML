# Grover's Search Algorithm

Grover's Search Algorithm [1] is an algorithm which can speed up an unstructured search problem quadratically using amplitude amplification. A detailed walkthrough can be found [here](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/composer/docs/iqx/guide/grovers-algorithm). The file `grover_example_sudoku.py` provides an example of how to use the algorithm to solve a sudoku puzzle of size 2x2.
